First attempt to build a fully functional fullstack app. An online car market. 

Tech stack:
Spring boot web flux backend, 
Redis for session based auth,
Mongo db reactive,
Vue.js typescript tailwind frontend,
hosted on fly.io

Although functional, it still has much room for improvement in terms of DRY, SOLID, modularization, semantic html and theming.
