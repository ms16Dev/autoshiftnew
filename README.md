First attempt to build a fully functional fullstack app. An online car market. 

Tech stack:
Spring boot web flux backend, 
Redis for session based auth,
Mongo db reactive,
Vue.js typescript tailwind frontend,
hosted on fly.io
Live app: https://autoshift-frontend.fly.dev/home

Although functional, it still has much room for improvement in terms of DRY, SOLID, modularization, semantic html and theming.
